# Introduction

Digital Emblems provide a mechanism for conveying a set of attributes
bound to an asset that is presented to a validator and
asserted by an issuer.

The DIEM WG seeks to define a standard architecture, set of emblem types, and presentation
methods that will provide a cohesive approach to creating, displaying, and
interpreting emblems across applications and platforms.

There are three dimensions to digital emblems: Asset Type, Emblem Type, and 
Validator Relationship. Assets bound to digital emblems can be analog (e.g., a vehicle) or
digital (e.g., a web server). They
differ in the initial interaction between the asset and the validator. Digital
Emblems can fall into multiple types (e.g., self-signed, attested, etc.) that will
affect how a validator interprets and trusts the assertions made within the emblem.
The relationship between the asset and the validator will influence requirements on how
validators retrieve digital emblems for the asset. These three dimensions will be key
drivers in the development of a digital emblem architecture.

# Archtectural Consideration

"To bear an emblem" means to use or adopt a symbol, figure, or device as an identifying mark. 
The entity that bears the emblem is respectively the bearer or emblem holder. This can be a separate entity
from the emblem issuer.

To "verify an emblem" means to confirm the authenticity or legitimacy of a particular symbol or design, often by checking its details against a known standard or reference point. 
Emblems may be observed by verifiers without the knowledge of the bearer displaying the emblem, or may be presented to a specific verifier upon request.
However, cryptographic verification can be optional as long is the emblem can be correctly interpreted.
Therefore, to be effective, the semantics of an emblem must be well known, easily recognizable, and distinguishable from other emblems.

The architecture, spcified by this group, must be flexible enough to support multiple serialization formats, securing mechanisms, discovery mechanisms, and use cases. 

# Initial Scope

The working group will focus its initial work on assets that are discovered by use
of digital communication as the primary interaction method that have the
unique challenge of the validator remaining unknown to the operator of the asset.
Other use cases for future consideration may also cover assets that lack this requirement
or even require separate digital discovery. The WG will ensure maximum reuse of work
for emblem representation and binding. A discovery
mechanism for the initial work will only be specified by this group after the initial emblem
binding protocol is completed (see the Deliverables section below).‚Äù

The working group is tasked with developing: 1) use cases and requirements related to the
initial scope, 2) an architecture that captures the relationships between entities utilizing
digital emblems, 3) a specification on binding digital emblems to assets, and 4) a specification
for discovery mechanisms supported by the initial scope.

The working group will liaise with appropriate organizations and relevant IETF WGs when
defining emblem formats, validation, and discovery mechanisms to facilitate re-use of existing
protocols and capabilities.

## Deliverables

The DIEM WG will work on the following milestones for the defined scope:

1. Use cases and requirements for the initial target scenarios (Informational)
2. Architecture document containing a taxonomy and overall information flows (Informational)
3. A protocol specification describing the binding of emblems to assets (Proposed Standard or Experimental)
4. A protocol specification describing the emblem discovery mechanism for the initial use cases (Proposed Standard
or Experimental)

Proposed Revised Charter for Working Group

The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP, STD 69) is the standard application-layer client-server protocol for the provisioning and management of objects stored in a shared central repository.
To ensure interoperable implementations it's important to coordinate and standardize EPP extensions.

The registration process of the EPP Extensions Registry is documented in RFC 7451. 
Extensions may be registered for informational purposes as long as there is a published specification that has been reviewed by a designated expert(s).

The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP, STD 95) is the standard for retrieving registration data and metadata from both Domain Name Registries (DNRs) and Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). 
To ensure interoperable implementations it is important to coordinate and standardize extensions and profiles to be used by registries.

The registration process for extensions to the RDAP is documented in RFC 7480. 
Extensions may be registered for informational purposes as long as there is a published specification that has been reviewed by a designated expert(s).

Extensions to both protocols that are targeted for the IETF consensus are subject to more thorough review and open discussion within the IETF. 
In addition, commonality may be discovered in related extensions for which it would make sense to merge them into a single standard extension everybody agrees on.

The REGEXT working group is the home of the coordination effort for EPP and RDAP extensions. 
The selection of extensions shall incorporate the following guidelines:

Proprietary documented extensions and individual submissions will follow the expert review process as described in the appropriate extensions registry. 
These extension documents will not be part of the REGEXT working group work or milestones. 
The working group may discuss or advise on these documents.

* Extensions that seek IETF consensus can be suggested for WG adoption. 
  If accepted by the working group then the development of the extension may proceed.

* When there are no more proposals for IETF consensus extensions, the working group will either close or become dormant, with the decision made in consultation with the responsible AD. 
  In any case, the mailing list will remain open and available for the use of the expert review process.

The working group may also take on work to develop specifications that are related to the EPP or RDAP registration processes, describe the information exchanged between entities involved in Internet identifier registration that are using the RDAP or EPP protocols. 
This decision will be made in consultation with the responsible AD.  
Possible work includes, but is not limited to the following topics:

* Uniform representation formats for publishing local policy or configuration options regarding EPP and RDAP use.

* Data formats for files exchanged between registration entities that need insertion in or extraction from EPP or RDAP.

* Technical guidance for registration processes that are supported by EPP or RDAP.

* The specification of application transport protocols for EPP and RDAP based on existing RFCs.
